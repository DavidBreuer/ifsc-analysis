# ifsc-analysis

## Introduction

Climbing is fun!
Since 2007 the International Federation of Sport Climbing (<a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/">IFSC</a>) organizes competitive sport climbing events.
These events cover the disciplines of lead climbing, speed climbing, and bouldering (as well as a combined format).

Here, we focus on and analyze the available data of all IFSC bouldering competitions. 
Who were and are the strongest competition climbers of their time? 
Can we find climbing styles by correlating who climbed similar boulders? 
Who is able to climb through qualification, semi-finals, and finals without falling off the wall? 
Which competitions were the hardest?

## Usage

All current analyses and results are published as <a href="https://DavidBreuer.github.io/ifsc-analysis">GitHub Pages</a>. 

We'll update the current data set and analyses after the upcoming IFSC bouldering events.

If you want to collect new data yourself, please run the collect.py script which uses Python Selenium.

Our analyses and explanations are available via the Jupyter Lab Notebook index.ipynb.

For convenience, we are using <a href="https://github.com/DavidBreuer/ifsc-analysis/actions">GitHub Actions</a> to automatically generate new GitHub Pages by converting the Notebook to plain HTML via Docker after each change in the repository.
